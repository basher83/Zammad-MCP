## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial implementation of Zammad MCP Server
- 16 tools for ticket, user, and organization management
- 3 resources for direct data access (ticket, user, organization)
- 3 pre-built prompts for common support scenarios
- Support for multiple authentication methods (API token, OAuth2, username/password)
- Comprehensive Pydantic models for type safety
- Setup scripts for Windows and Unix systems
- Support for running via `uvx` directly from GitHub
- Sentinel pattern for better type safety with `_UNINITIALIZED`
- Documentation for GitHub Actions security secrets configuration
- Comprehensive GitHub workflows documentation in CONTRIBUTING.md

### Changed

- Simplified escalated ticket count calculation using tuple instead of list
- Updated all development commands to use `uv run` prefix
- Modern Python 3.10+ type annotations throughout
- Switched from manual Safety CLI execution to official pyupio/safety-action in GitHub workflows
- Removed duplicate Codacy Trivy scan from security-scan.yml (already covered by dedicated Codacy workflow)

### Fixed

- Fixed MCP server startup issue where `asyncio.run()` was called within an already running event loop
- Fixed Pydantic validation errors when Zammad API returns string representations for expanded fields instead of objects
- Added support for both string and object types in all model expanded fields:
  - Ticket model: group, state, priority, customer, owner, organization, created_by, updated_by
  - Article model: created_by, updated_by
  - User model: organization, created_by, updated_by
  - Organization model: created_by, updated_by, members
- Fixed `get_ticket_stats` implementation to handle both string and object state formats
- Simplified environment configuration to use `.env` files with `python-dotenv` for better Claude Desktop compatibility
- Added `article_limit` and `article_offset` parameters to `get_ticket` to prevent token limit errors on tickets with many articles
- Fixed documentation inconsistency: all ZAMMAD_URL examples now correctly include `/api/v1` suffix

### Security

- Added authentication support for API tokens (recommended)
- Environment variable configuration for credentials

### Known Issues

- `get_ticket_stats` loads all tickets into memory (performance issue)
- No attachment support for tickets
- No URL validation (potential SSRF vulnerability)
- Missing `zammad://queue/{group}` resource
- Test coverage at 67% (target: 80%+)

## [0.1.0] - TBD

### Initial Release
