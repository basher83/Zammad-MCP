# Ultra-Think Analysis: Git Commit Command Intent vs Implementation

  üéØ Core Question

  Does the current git_commit.md command actually "address code quality issues" as its stated intent claims, or does it merely check for them?

  üìä Multi-Dimensional Analysis

  Dimension 1: Semantic Analysis of Intent

  "Git workflow orchestrator" implies:

- Conductor role: manages the entire flow from start to finish
- Decision-making: handles branching logic (if X, then Y)
- Error recovery: knows what to do when things fail
- State management: tracks progress through the workflow

  "Create clean, logical commits" implies:

- Commit crafting: organizing changes into atomic, meaningful units
- Message quality: conventional commit format, clear descriptions
- History clarity: reviewable, bisectable commits

  "While addressing any code quality issues" implies:

- ACTIVE intervention: "addressing" suggests fixing, not just detecting
- Blocking behavior: quality gate that prevents bad commits
- Remediation: either auto-fix or guide user to fix

  Dimension 2: Implementation Reality Check

  Current workflow:

  1. Show git status (readonly)
  2. Show git diff (readonly)
  3. Run pre-commit hooks ‚Üê Critical step
  4. Invoke commit-craft agent

  What actually happens with pre-commit hooks:

- Runs mise run pre-commit-run which executes pre-commit run --all-files
- Some hooks auto-fix (ruff format)
- Some hooks just check (mypy, bandit, semgrep)
- No explicit handling of failures
- No guidance on what to do if checks fail
- No re-run loop after fixes

  What commit-craft agent does:

- Runs pre-commit hooks again on each individual commit
- Creates logically organized commits
- Handles commit message formatting

  Dimension 3: Gap Analysis

  | Promised Capability    | Current Implementation                | Gap                                                |
  |------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
  | Orchestrate workflow   | Shows status, runs hooks, calls agent | ‚ö†Ô∏è No error handling, no conditional logic         |
  | Address quality issues | Runs checks that might auto-fix       | ‚ùå Doesn't verify fixes, doesn't guide manual fixes |
  | Create clean commits   | Delegates to commit-craft             | ‚úÖ Works well                                       |
  | Handle failures        | Not specified                         | ‚ùå Missing entirely                                 |
  | Feedback loop          | None                                  | ‚ùå Run once, hope it works                          |

  Dimension 4: Failure Mode Analysis

  Scenario 1: Auto-fixable issues (ruff format)

- Pre-commit runs, makes changes
- Changes are NOT staged
- git status now shows MORE modified files
- Commit-craft sees the formatting changes as uncommitted work
- Result: Confusing state, unclear what should be committed

  Scenario 2: Manual fix required (mypy error)

- Pre-commit runs, mypy fails
- Command output shows error
- Then what? No guidance provided
- User must manually fix, but command already proceeded to commit-craft
- Result: Workflow breaks, user confused

  Scenario 3: Hooks already passed

- User already ran pre-commit manually
- Command runs them again (redundant)
- Wastes time
- Result: Inefficient, but works

  Dimension 5: Architectural Philosophy

  Two competing philosophies detected:

  Philosophy A: Validate-Then-Commit

- Check quality first
- If pass ‚Üí proceed to commit
- If fail ‚Üí halt, require user intervention
- Simple, predictable, safe

  Philosophy B: Fix-Then-Commit

- Run auto-fixes
- Stage auto-fixes
- Report manual fixes needed
- Loop until clean
- Create commits from clean state
- Complex, but matches "addressing issues" claim

  Current implementation: Awkward hybrid that doesn't fully embrace either

  Dimension 6: User Experience Flow

  Ideal orchestrated flow:

  1. Check status ‚úì
  2. Run pre-commit hooks
     ‚îú‚îÄ If auto-fixes made ‚Üí stage them ‚Üí re-run hooks
     ‚îú‚îÄ If failures ‚Üí show guidance ‚Üí halt
     ‚îî‚îÄ If pass ‚Üí continue
  3. Verify working tree state
  4. Invoke commit-craft with clean state
  5. Verify each commit passes hooks
  6. Report success

  Current flow:

  1. Check status ‚úì
  2. Run pre-commit hooks ‚úì
  3. ??? (unstated)
  4. Invoke commit-craft ‚úì
  5. ??? (hope it works)

  Dimension 7: Command Responsibility Boundaries

  What should git_commit.md own?

- Pre-commit validation workflow
- Error handling and user guidance
- State verification before committing

  What should commit-craft agent own?

- Commit organization logic
- Message crafting
- File grouping decisions
- Individual commit validation

  Current problem: Unclear boundary‚Äîboth run pre-commit hooks, no coordination

  üîç Root Cause Identification

  The fundamental issue: The command description overpromises by using "addressing" when it really means "checking"

  Why this happened:

  1. The command was likely designed as a simple wrapper
  2. The description was written aspirationally
  3. Edge cases (hook failures, auto-fixes) weren't considered
  4. No user testing of failure scenarios

  üí° Proposed Solutions

  Solution 1: Honest Scope (Low effort, high clarity)

  Change description to match reality:
  "This command validates code quality and creates clean, logical commits"

  Clarify instructions:

- "Run pre-commit hooks to validate code quality"
- "If hooks fail, resolve issues manually and re-run this command"
- "If hooks pass, invoke commit-craft to organize commits"

  Pros: Truthful, sets correct expectations
  Cons: Doesn't actually improve the workflow

  Solution 2: True Orchestration (High effort, matches intent)

  Add explicit workflow steps:
  Instructions:
  - Review repository state
  - Run pre-commit hooks (auto-fixes will be staged)
  - Verify hooks pass (if failures, halt with guidance)
  - Run commit-craft agent only if clean
  - Verify final commits pass all hooks

  Add new commands:

- Stage auto-fixes: !git add -u (after pre-commit)
- Check for unstaged changes: !git status --short
- Conditional halt logic

  Pros: Actually orchestrates, handles edge cases
  Cons: Complex, requires more agent intelligence

  Solution 3: Simplified Delegation (Medium effort, cleaner architecture)

  Remove pre-commit from git_commit.md entirely:

- Let commit-craft handle all validation
- git_commit.md just does status checks + invokes agent
- Clearer responsibility boundaries

  Change description:
  "This command creates clean, logical commits from your changes"

  Pros: Simpler, avoids duplication, clearer roles
  Cons: Loses upfront validation step

  Solution 4: Interactive Fix Loop (Highest effort, best UX)

  Make the command interactive:

  1. Run hooks
  2. If auto-fixes ‚Üí stage ‚Üí show diff ‚Üí ask user to confirm
  3. If failures ‚Üí show errors ‚Üí ask "Fix now? (y/n)"
  4. If yes ‚Üí pause, let user fix, then re-run
  5. Loop until clean
  6. Then run commit-craft

  Pros: Truly handles quality issues, excellent UX
  Cons: Very complex, requires AskUserQuestion integration

  üéØ Recommendations Ranked by Priority

  Priority 1: Immediate - Fix the Lie (Required)

  The description must match implementation. Either:

- A) Change description to "validates" not "addresses", OR
- B) Add actual issue-addressing behavior

  Priority 2: Short-term - Handle Auto-Fixes (High value)

  Add instruction step:

- After pre-commit runs, stage any auto-fixed files
- Re-run pre-commit to verify fixes

  Priority 3: Short-term - Add Failure Guidance (High value)

  Add conditional logic:

- If pre-commit fails:
  - Review errors above
  - Fix issues manually
  - Run `mise run pre-commit-run` again
  - Re-run this command when clean

  Priority 4: Medium-term - Eliminate Duplication (Efficiency)

  Decide: Does git_commit.md or commit-craft own pre-commit validation?
  Currently both do it ‚Üí wasteful and confusing

  Priority 5: Long-term - True Orchestration (Aspirational)

  Build the full interactive fix loop if the "addressing" promise is important

  ü§î Strategic Questions for Decision-Making

  1. What is the actual user need?
  - Quick commit creation? ‚Üí Simplify
  - Quality enforcement? ‚Üí Add validation
  - Learning tool? ‚Üí Add guidance
  1. What should "addressing quality issues" mean?
  - Auto-fixing formatting? (achievable)
  - Guiding manual fixes? (medium complexity)
  - Blocking bad commits? (easy)
  - All of the above? (hard)
  1. Who is the target user?
  - Experienced devs ‚Üí Minimal hand-holding
  - Junior devs ‚Üí More guidance needed
  - Mixed team ‚Üí Balance both
  1. What's the tolerance for complexity?
  - Simple wrapper ‚Üí Solution 3
  - Smart orchestrator ‚Üí Solution 2 or 4
  - Just be honest ‚Üí Solution 1

  üìã Concrete Changes Needed (Minimum Viable)

  Must fix:

  1. Either change "addressing" to "checking/validating" in description
  2. OR add explicit handling of pre-commit hook failures
  3. Add guidance for what to do when hooks fail

  Should add:
  4. Stage auto-fixed files after pre-commit runs
  5. Re-run hooks after auto-fixes to verify
  6. Check working tree status before invoking commit-craft

  Could enhance:
  7. Add conditional logic for failure scenarios
  8. Add interactive confirmation for auto-fixes
  9. Add summary of what quality checks were performed

  ---
  My recommendation: Start with Solution 1 (be honest) + elements of Solution 2 (handle auto-fixes), then evolve toward Solution 4 (interactive) if user feedback demands it.

  The current biggest lie is "addressing" when it means "checking" ‚Äî that must be fixed first.
